## About Me

I am a web developer, cybersecurity enthusiast, and student of all things tech.

Nearly a decade ago, I joined Code Ninjas and earned my Black Belt in programming. From there, I discovered cybersecurity through GenCyber and attended for three years. After joining a competitive cybersecurity team, I secured an internship with MidAmerican Energy Company—the only high school student accepted into their Cybersecurity Internship. I continue to grow in the field and look forward to future opportunities.
