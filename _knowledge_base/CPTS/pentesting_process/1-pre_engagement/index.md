# Pre Engagement

## Overview

Pre-Engagement involves all the steps taken prior to engaging with the target. Thus, it is critical to understand both the steps that must be taken with the client, as well as the possibilities for what you can do.

This phase ensures the engagement is legally authorized, clearly scoped, and fully aligned with the expectations of both parties. It also lays the groundwork for a successful and ethical penetration test.

## Types of Penetration Tests

- **Blackbox** – Minimal information provided (e.g., IPs, domains)
- **Greybox** – Moderate information provided (e.g., IPs, domains, subnets, hostnames)
- **Whitebox** – All available information shared, including credentials and configurations
- **Red-Teaming** – May include social engineering or physical testing
- **Purple-Teaming** – Red team engagement conducted in collaboration with the blue team

## Testing Environments (May Include)

- Networks  
- Web Applications  
- Mobile Applications  
- APIs  
- Thick Clients  
- IoT Devices  
- Cloud Infrastructure  
- Source Code  
- Physical Security  
- Employees  
- Hosts / Servers  
- Security Policies  
- Firewalls  
- IDS/IPS

## Legal Considerations (US)

- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)** – Unauthorized access = criminal offense
- **Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)** – Prohibits bypassing copyright protections
- **Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)** – Limits interception and storage of electronic communication
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** – Regulates healthcare data privacy
- **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)** – Regulates data collection for users under 13

### Precautionary Measures

- Always obtain written consent from authorized parties
- Operate strictly within the agreed-upon scope
- Avoid any damage to systems
- Do not access personal data or intercept communications without explicit permission
- Be especially cautious when testing HIPAA-regulated environments

## NDA Types

- **Unilateral** – Only one party is bound to secrecy
- **Bilateral** – Both parties protect information; most common in pentesting
- **Multilateral** – Multiple parties bound; used for cooperative or multi-organization testing
