# Information Gathering

## Overview

Information Gathering, also commonly known as **Reconnaissance** or **Recon**, involves discovering as much information as possible about the target **prior to any exploitation**. The goal is to reduce assumptions and build a clear picture of the target environment.

Recon is often split into two phases:

- **Passive Reconnaissance** – No direct interaction with the target
- **Active Reconnaissance** – Direct interaction with the target (e.g., sending packets, scanning)

Both forms of recon are crucial to developing effective attack strategies.

## Passive Reconnaissance

Passive Recon is stealthy and indirect. The idea is to gather intel **without touching the target’s systems**, reducing the risk of detection. It is useful in the early stages or when operating under strict RoE.

### Goals

- Identify domain names, IPs, and infrastructure
- Discover public-facing services
- Analyze public personas, emails, and leaks
- Map organizational structure
- Collect publicly exposed credentials

### Techniques

- **Google Dorking**  
  - `site:example.com inurl:login`
  - `intitle:index.of` to find open directories

- **WHOIS Lookup**
  - Discover registrant, contact info, nameservers, etc.
  - Tools: `whois`, [whois.domaintools.com](https://whois.domaintools.com)

- **DNS Enumeration**
  - Passive record gathering (e.g., `dig`, `host`)
  - Subdomain discovery using wordlists (e.g., `crt.sh`, `amass` in passive mode)

- **Certificate Transparency Logs**
  - Discover subdomains through certificates issued
  - Tool: [crt.sh](https://crt.sh)

- **Public Breach Databases**
  - Find leaked credentials or emails
  - Tools: [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com), Dehashed, Snusbase

- **Metadata Extraction**
  - Download public files and extract metadata
  - Tools: `exiftool`, `strings`, FOCA

- **Social Media & OSINT**
  - LinkedIn (for employees, tech stack)
  - Twitter, GitHub (API keys, credentials in code)

### Tools for Passive Recon

- `theHarvester`
- `Maltego`
- `SpiderFoot`
- `Amass` (in passive mode)
- `Recon-ng`
- `FOCA` (Windows metadata tool)

## Active Reconnaissance

Active Recon directly interacts with the target and can be detected. It is used to **enumerate services, users, configurations, and vulnerabilities** that are not discoverable passively.

### Goals

- Discover live hosts
- Enumerate open ports and running services
- Identify OS and version information
- Detect misconfigurations or default setups
- Map the network and identify points of entry

### Techniques

- **Ping Sweeps & Host Discovery**
  - Tools: `nmap -sn`, `fping`, `netdiscover`

- **Port Scanning**
  - Identify open ports and basic banners
  - Tools: `nmap`, `masscan`, `rustscan`

- **Service Enumeration**
  - Identify version numbers and service banners
  - Tools: `nmap -sV`, `nc`, `telnet`, `curl`, `whatweb`

- **OS Fingerprinting**
  - Determine OS and kernel versions
  - Tools: `nmap -O`, `xprobe2`

- **DNS Zone Transfers**
  - Attempt AXFR transfers
  - Tools: `dig @ns1.example.com example.com AXFR`

- **SMB, SNMP, and Other Protocol Enumeration**
  - SMB: `enum4linux`, `smbclient`
  - SNMP: `snmpwalk`
  - FTP: Check for anonymous login

- **Web Server Enumeration**
  - Check for directories, login pages, parameters
  - Tools: `dirb`, `gobuster`, `ffuf`, `nikto`

### Tools for Active Recon

- `nmap`
- `masscan`
- `netcat (nc)`
- `curl`
- `dirb`, `gobuster`, `ffuf`
- `enum4linux`
- `ldapsearch`
- `smbclient`

## Summary Table

| Type         | Risk of Detection | Data Collected                              | Tools                         |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Passive      | Low               | Domains, subdomains, leaks, metadata        | `theHarvester`, `crt.sh`, `whois`, `Maltego` |
| Active       | Medium–High       | Live hosts, services, banners, OS info      | `nmap`, `masscan`, `gobuster`, `enum4linux`  |

## Next Steps

Once the recon phase is complete, this information feeds directly into the **Vulnerability Assessment** phase, where you assess what flaws may be present in the identified services or systems.
