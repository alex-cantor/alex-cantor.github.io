This is both my notes, and your ultimate guide to CPTS (and pentesting in general!).

## What is CPTS

CPTS, or Certified Penetration Testing Specialist, is a certification offered by HackTheBox. I am going to discuss the certification in two parts: the course and the exam itself.

### The Course

**General Overview**: The CPTS course is, as of current, consists of 28 modules. Each of the modules ranges from an estimated few hours to a few days completion time, where a "day" consists of eight-hours. In conjunction with HTB's predictions and my own calculations, CPTS is expected to take 43, 8 hour days. This means, in total, it is predicted that the course will take 344 hours to complete. One should only attempt this course if they are willing to put in the time necessary for completion. At the final certification of the exam, one must find at least 12/14 flags and write a professional-grade report, often lasting 100 or more pages. This exam is to be taken over the course of 10 days, which many have found to be the perfect amount of time.

**About the Course**: The CPTS course teaches everything from approaching a penetration test (through initial contact with the client) to initial enumeration of the target to attacks to privilege escalation to reporting. All the while, the course covers general networks, Active Directory, and web. The course prepares individuals to enter the workforce as an intermediate pentester.

### The Exam

I have not yet taken the exam. Once I do, I will update that will more info.

That being said, based on what I have read, I can answer to the following: the exam takes place over ten days, most of which are utilized by many people. To pass the exam, you must capture at least 10/12 possible flags; additionally, you must complete a final report to a satisfactory degree.
