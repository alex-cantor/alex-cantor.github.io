# Knowledge Base

This section of my GitHub repo will serve to me as one location for my notes, as well as a location for you to learn some of what I have to share. I hope to write about everything I know, though of course this is not possible to do in full. That being said, moving forward, as I learn, I will do my best to transcribe what I do learn, as well as write about stuff and explain stuff I have learned in the past.

The Knowledge Base will be split into folders based on topic. Some folders will cover certifications, some will common general knowledge areas, and others may come along that I have not thought of yet.
