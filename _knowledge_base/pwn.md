# Pwn

This is my ultimate knowledge base of Pwn / Binary Exploitation

---

## What is Pwn

Pwn is essentially just the competitive offshoot of Binary Exploitation, where one tries to exploit vulnerabilities in compiled programs (binaries) to achieve some unintended behavior, often gain access to a flag.

## My Background

As of beginning to study pwn (7/3/2025), I began learning to code 10 years ago at CodeNinjas. I learned multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, C#) which prepared me for future college classes I would end up taking (notably, C++ and C). However, I, at this point, do not remember most of it. I am beginning my journey of getting as good as I can get at pwn.

## Why Pwn?

As I, you may be wondering what the point of learning pwn is. Pwn, as earlier noted, is the competetive side of Binary Exploitation; thus, naturally, understanding the benefits of learning Binary Exploitation is critical in understanding the benefits of learning pwn.

There are numerous benefits to learning binary exploitation: gain a deeper understanding of computers, learn a sector of computer science / cybersecurity, gain stronger programing skills, learn transferable skills, gain prestige and community, advance in your job, among others. By learning binary exploitation, you are forced to learn numerous aspects of a computer, notably, how they work. Thus, 



**Gain a Deep Understanding of Computers**
Ok. Gain a deep(er) understanding of computers. In my opinion, this is the biggest piece; most of the below items will fall under / relate to this point. By learning binary exploitation, you are forced to learn numerous aspects of a computer

**Learn a Sector of Computer Science / Cybersecurity**

**Gain Stronger Programming Skills**

**Learn Transferable Skills**

**Gain Prestige and Community**

**Advance in your Job**
