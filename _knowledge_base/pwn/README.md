# Pwn

This is my ultimate knowledge base of Pwn / Binary Exploitation

## What is Pwn

Pwn is essentially just the competitive offshoot of Binary Exploitation, where one tries to exploit vulnerabilities in compiled programs (binaries) to achieve some unintended behavior, often gain access to a flag.

## My Background

As of beginning to study pwn (7/3/2025), I began learning to code 10 years ago at CodeNinjas. I learned multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, C#) which prepared me for future college classes I would end up taking (notably, C++ and C). However, I, at this point, do not remember most of it. I am beginning my journey of getting as good as I can get at pwn.
